Commands:
docker run -it devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise

I searched dockerhub with:
devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise

In readme was text:
This is the readme, use input "basics" to complete this exercise.

To input "basics" to command line:
Give me the password: basics
You found the correct password. Secret message is:
